# Stock-Analysis-Repository with VBA and Excel
Perforing Stock Analysis with VBA and Microsoft Excel

## Overview of the Project
For this Project, we performed analysis of Stock Data for the years 2018 and 2017. After performing the analysis we edited or "refactored" the VBA code for the Stock Market Dataset to increase the efficiency of our code. Our target was to refactor the code so that it would loop through the data and collect the required information rathan than running individual loops for each individual stock. 

## Results
For our analysis, we looked at two factors: Total Daily Volume and Return. Total Daily volume, which is number of trades for a specific stock on a given day, is aggregated over the course of the year and Return, which is the percentage change in share price from the begining to the end of a given period, is calculated by taking the share price at the begining and end of the year and determining the percentage change. In addition, we have colour coded the percentage returns with a positive return donoted by the green colour while a negative change is denoted by the red colour.  

The results of our anaysis has been summerized in two (2) tables below (refer to screenshot below):

The Raw data file with the VBA scripts [Stock Analysis](https://github.com/shahkibria/Stock-Analysis-Repository/blob/main/VBA_Challenge.xlsm.zip) have also been included for your benefit

The edits to the VBA code that we performed helped to make the VBA script efficient and reduce run times. The original run times for the VBA script is show below
